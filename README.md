# GoBank

This is just a practice project. :)

Based on [Complete JSON API project in Golang (JWT, Postgres, and Docker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZuNmAzaH8&list=PL0xRBLFXXsP6nudFDqMXzrvQCZrxSOm-2) by [Anthony GG](https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_)

PS: Thank you! :) I needed some finger work. :)

## Http REST Client

To test the http endpoints of the application, you can use [PostMan](https://www.postman.com), [ThunderClient](https://www.thunderclient.com), but I prefer VSCode Rest Client. It allows me to create a simple `.http` file an define raw HTTP requests in it. It also supports dotenv files and can work with the results of the requests. See: [requests.http](requests.http)

> And it can be also part of your internal documentation. :)
